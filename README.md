Hello, I am OndÅ™ej Mottl.

I am a researcher with a main focus on quantitative ecology, macroecology, palaeoecology, and community ecology with an interest in data science.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on developing state-of-the-art tools to study global biodiversity patterns and lowering the barriers to scientific exploration.
